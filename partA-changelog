	- Previously Exercise 1.7 could not be done using natural deduction
	(previously: Prove P -> not P is not valid)
	The preceding remark also contained a mistake.
	I have fixed the preceding remark, added a different Exercise 1.7,
	and explained the previous exercise in a remark after the new
	Exercise 1.7.

	- Minor typo fixed at the end of the appendix in rule bot_e
