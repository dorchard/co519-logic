\maketitle

\noindent
These are the accompanying notes for the logic part of CO519. They
provide a counterpart to the lectures, but they do not replace them; the
lectures will provide content, examples, detail, and discussion not given in
these notes.  However, the notes also provide additional exercises and
examples, and some additional detail beyond what is assessed on this
course-- this will be pointed out when it happens.

These notes also act as a counterpart to the \textbf{course textbook},
\emph{Logic in Computer Science} (by Huth and Ryan) which I
recommend. We will only cover some of the material from the first two
chapters due to the short length of this part of the course. I
recommend reading these chapters (they have further exercises and
examples), but the assessable material for this course is covered in
lectures and these notes (excluding the appendices); the textbook
contains extra detail which is not assessed, but worth learning.

If you spot any errors or have suggested edits, the notes are written
in LaTeX and are available on GitHub at
\url{http://github.com/dorchard/co519-logic}. Please fork and submit a
pull request with any suggested changes.

The \textbf{last page of these notes} provides a section for you to
write down any topics you do not yet understand, or feel that you need
to work on more. By writing these down during the course, you offload
the task of remembering what you need to work on. You can then look
back at this list when you are studying, and eventually cross off items
as you get to grips with the material.

\section*{Aide-m\'{e}moire}

\noindent
Write down any terms, symbols, concepts, techniques, etc. that
you don't yet understand or would like to grasp better.
You can cross these out (and move them to the right-hand column) as you make progress:
it might be 5 minutes after you first write the
item down here, or it might be 5 minutes before the exam.
This will help you to keep a record of the things you
need to work on.
